A WearOS companion app to trigger time tracking events from your wrist. Designed for use with 
[SimpleTimeTracker](https://github.com/Razeeman/Android-SimpleTimeTracker) version 1.20 or later.

NOTE: This application is currently hard-coded to the specific set of activities and tags defined in
[`TimeTrackingActivity.kt`](./wear/src/main/java/dev/jhale/android/wear/simpletimetracker/data/TimeTrackingActivity.kt).
To use this application with different activities/tags you will have to edit that file, recompile,
and install on your devices.
